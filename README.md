## Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of Angular Material Admin on your local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone -o angular-material-admin -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/flatlogic/angular-material-admin.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
```

#### 2. Run `npm install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.

#### 3. Run `npm start`

This command will build the app from the source files. Then open `localhost:4200` in your browser.

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start
hacking. The page must be served from a web server, e.g. apache, nginx, WebStorm built-in web server, etc., otherwise some features may not work properly.
